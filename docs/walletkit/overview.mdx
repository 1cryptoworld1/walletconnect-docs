# WalletKit

WalletKit allows you to easily connect your Web3 wallet with dapps. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for dapps to request actions such as signing transactions and interacting with smart contracts on the blockchain. The SDK is designed to work with any blockchain, making it easy to support multiple chains without the need for separate integration code.

### Features

Some of the key features of the Web3Wallet SDK include:

- **Sign API**: Allows dapps to request that the user sign a transaction or message.
- **Auth API**: Allows dapps to verify wallet address ownership through a single signature request, realizing login in one action.
- **Chain agnostic**: The Web3Wallet SDK is designed to work with any blockchain, so you can easily support multiple chains without having to write separate integration code.
