# Notifications

The WalletKit Notify API is designed to enhance the interaction between wallet users and dapps by offering a robust notification system.
This API empowers wallet developers to implement a dynamic notification experience directly within their wallets.
It provides the functionality for users to opt-in to notifications, ensuring they stay informed about critical events and interactions.

The Notify API is versatile, with support for both iOS and Android platforms, making it an ideal choice for cross-platform wallet applications.

Coupled with the [AppKit Notifications](../../appkit/features/notifications), the Notify API forms part of a comprehensive toolkit that enables seamless integration of web3 communication and messaging features into dapps.
