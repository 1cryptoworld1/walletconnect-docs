# Customization

The AppKit uses Unity's [UI Toolkit](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UIElements.html) system.
By following this guide,you can customize the AppKit to match your game's style, even if you have minimal or no prior
knowledge of UI Toolkit.

## Theming

The AppKit relies heavily on [Unity Style Sheet (USS) variables](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UIE-USS-variables.html)
for easy customization of various UI aspects, such as colors, spacing, border radius, and more.

### Preparation

The first step in theming the AppKit is to create a custom panel settings asset, followed by a custom theme file.
Then, link them to the AppKit.

1. In Unity Editor, right-click in the Project window and select **Create -> UI Toolkit -> Panel Settings Asset**.
2. Right-click again in the Project window and select **Create -> UI Toolkit -> TSS Theme File**.
3. Select the newly created Panel Settings Asset, and in the Inspector window, assign the newly created TSS Theme File
to the `Theme Style Sheet` field.
4. In the same Inspector window, set `Reference DPI` to 160. This is the recommended DPI for the AppKit, but feel free
to adjust it to your needs.

5. Open the TSS Theme File with your code editor and change the first line to:
```css
@import url("/Packages/com.walletconnect.web3modal/UI Toolkit/WUI Base Theme.tss");
```
6. Under `Web3Modal` prefab instance in your scene or prefab find `Modal` child object and assign the
newly created `Panel Settings Asset` to the `Panel Settings` field of `UI Document` component.

Everything is set up, now you can start customizing the AppKit to match your game's style.

### Overriding Variables

To override a variable, simply add it to your TSS Theme File and assign a new value to it.
The example below changes the accent color to a shade of orange and the modal border color to a shade of gray.

```css
@import url("/Packages/com.walletconnect.web3modal/UI Toolkit/WUI Base Theme.tss");

* {
    --wui-color-accent-100: rgb(156, 81, 65);

    --wui-accent-glass-090: rgba(156, 81, 65, 0.9);
    --wui-accent-glass-080: rgba(156, 81, 65, 0.8);
    --wui-accent-glass-020: rgba(156, 81, 65, 0.2);
    --wui-accent-glass-015: rgba(156, 81, 65, 0.15);
    --wui-accent-glass-010: rgba(156, 81, 65, 0.1);
    --wui-accent-glass-005: rgba(156, 81, 65, 0.05);
    --wui-accent-glass-002: rgba(156, 81, 65, 0.02);

    --wui-modal-border-color: #9a9085;
    --wui-modal-border-width: 3px;
}
```

You can find the list of all available variables in the [WUI Base Theme](https://github.com/WalletConnect/Web3ModalUnity/blob/main/Packages/com.walletconnect.web3modal/UI%20Toolkit/WUI%20Base%20Theme.tss)
file.

### Custom Fonts

To override the default font, you need to add a custom font to your project and reference it in the TSS Theme File.
```css
@import url("/Packages/com.walletconnect.web3modal/UI Toolkit/WUI Base Theme.tss");

* {
    -unity-font-definition: resource("Custom Fonts/Comic Sans SDF Regular");
}
```
