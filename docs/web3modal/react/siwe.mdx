# Sign In With Ethereum

Web3Modal SDK provides a simple solution for integrating with "Sign In With Ethereum" (SIWE), a new form of authentication that enables users to control their digital identity with their Ethereum account.
SIWE is a standard also known as [EIP-4361](https://docs.login.xyz/general-information/siwe-overview/eip-4361).

## One-Click Auth

**One-Click Auth** represents a key advancement within WalletConnect v2, streamlining the user authentication process by enabling them to seamlessly connect with a wallet and sign a SIWE message with just one click. 
 It internally integrates **CACAO** ([CAIP-74](https://chainagnostic.org/CAIPs/caip-74)) and **SIWX** ([CAIP-122](https://chainagnostic.org/CAIPs/caip-122)) standards.
