# Sending with Cloud

You can send notifications to users who have subscribed to your app. You target specific groups users by [notification types](./cloud-setup#notification-types).

To try this, you can use the utility provided in cloud under the Notify API section:

1. In the APIs tab of your project, navigate to the Notify API section. You should see a banner with a link to the Send Notification playground.

   <img className="image-margin" src={useBaseUrl('/img/w3i/notify-playground.png')} />

1. This allows you to send notifications to your subscribers. After you select the associated project, you can select the notification type, title, body, and link to send to your subscribers.

   <img className="image-margin" src={useBaseUrl('/img/w3i/notify-playground-send.png')} />
